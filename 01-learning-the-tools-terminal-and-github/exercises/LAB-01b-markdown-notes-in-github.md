## Markdown Notes in GitHub

### For this lab, we are going to create a repo for you to take notes throughout the week.

1. Create a repo with a README.md on Github:
    ```
    LAB-01b-markdown-notes-in-github.md
    ```
1. `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory
1. Clone your repo on the command line
1. `cd` into your repo from the command line
1. `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory
1. Open the project in VSCode by typing `code .` in that directory.
1. Using either VSCode, or from the command line, once you're in your repo, create a file tree that looks like this:

    ```
    <repo name>
        |__ day-1
            |__ notes.md
        |__ day-2
            |__ notes.md
        |__ day-3
            |__ notes.md
        |__ day-4
            |__ notes.md
        |__ day-5
            |__ notes.md
        |__ README.md

    ```

1. **ACP your code and push it to your main branch!**
1. Add some of your notes from today in your day-1 markdown file being sure to play around with markup features including bullet lists, tables, bold or italicized text, and headers
1. **ACP your code and push it to your main branch!**
1. In README.md, add links to each of your 5 days of notes
1. **ACP your code (again!) and push it to your main branch (again)!**

1. Put the link to the repo in the canvas submission.
