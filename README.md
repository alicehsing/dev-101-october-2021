##  First things first: screen share
![](./screen-share.png)

## Our tools
- VSCode with ESLint
  - basically, Microsoft Word with spell check for code
- Git/Github
  - version control
  - 'facebook for code'
- The Browser
  - Chrome, please! 
  - [64% of web users are on Chrome, so that's our target browser](https://gs.statcounter.com/)
- Terminal, Git/Bash, or WSL (Ubuntu on Windows)
  - For Windows users, WSL is a way to run an actual Linux distribution. However (since it's Linux) it has weird, difficult edges anyway, let alone on Windows. If WSL is causing you a lot of problems, download Git/Bash for easy mode.
